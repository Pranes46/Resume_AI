How I built this AI: I built a chatbot using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enable context-aware responses grounded in custom documents. I began by loading the relevant documents and splitting them into coherent chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which ensures semantic integrity by breaking the text along logical boundaries like paragraphs and sentences. These chunks were then embedded using OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` model to generate dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning. I stored these vectors in a FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) vector store, which was ideal for this small-scale project due to its in-memory speed and efficient similarity search capabilities. When a user submits a query, the system retrieves the most relevant document chunks from FAISS and passes them, along with the query, to GPT-3.5 Turbo for final answer synthesis. This approach combines precise retrieval with the natural language generation capabilities of the LLM, ensuring the chatbot produces accurate, context-rich responses tailored to the user's input.

If asked anything about how can i replicate this and stuff please elaboarte on the topics which i used to create it and provide a guide.
